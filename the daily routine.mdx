## How to use Hardware FYI Pro
Before diving in, here are a couple words of wisdom from our collective experience.

The most effective way to interview is to put yourself in the mindset that you are in job application season. If you are able to lock in and block out distractions for 1-2 months, you‚Äôll reap amazing results. It‚Äôll be a bit stressful at times, but when you finally land your dream job, this short spurt of intense work will be completely worth it.

The team at Hardware FYI can speak first-hand to how this process helped them land their current roles:

**Testimonial #1:**

> üë®‚Äçüîß At the start of my last semester at college, I was told from a startup that I‚Äôd worked at over the summer that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to return to their company as a full-time engineer.
From January to March, I applied to over 200 jobs, and ultimately landed 3 job offers (Apple and 2 startups in the Bay Area). In January, I recalled next to nothing about statics, mechanics of materials, or thermodynamics from my classes. I decided to put everything else on hold to prepare for interview, and in hindsight I am so glad I did.
Now, I‚Äôm living in my dream city and working at my dream company.


**Testimonimal #2**
> üë®üèº‚Äçüîß Starting winter quarter of my junior year to the end of my senior year (2019-2020), I applied to 200+ roles and collectively interviewed at 64 companies (Apple, SpaceX, Lyft, Tesla, etc.). I grew to understand that the job market is ruthlessly competitive and the best way to land my dream job was to increase the volume of applications and to improve my technical interviewing skills.
After intensive preparation of engineering fundamentals, I landed 5+ offers and work in my dream sector of climate tech.
