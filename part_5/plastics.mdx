## What are Plastics?

Plastics fall in the polymer categories of engineering materials, the other three being metals, ceramics and composites.

> 📖 To get really technical, plastics are a range of synthetic materials that use polymers of long carbon chains. The first fully synthetic plastic was derived in 1907 by a Belgian Chemist, Leo Baekeland, by combining formaldehyde and phenol under heat and pressure. Since 1950, 9.2 billion tons of plastic are estimated to have been made!

> The word plastic is actually derived from the Greek word **lastikos**, meaning “*capable of being shaped or molded.*”

Plastics have become so abundantly used for several key advantages:

- Easily molded into various shapes (infinitely customizable depending on molding process).
- Low production cost per part
- Lightweight, corrosion-resistant
- Poor conductor of heat/electricity
- Use in low-cost structural components (pipes, wires, construction of buildings, etc.)

Overall, the low density, strength, user-friendly designs, fabrication capabilities, extended life, low weight, and low cost are all characteristics that have contributed to its rapid rise.

In engineering applications, plastics are typically separated into two categories: **thermo-set and thermoplastics.** Thermoplastics and thermoset plastics are commonly used in injection molding, and each of the two have their own unique advantages.

> **Thermoset Plastics**: Linked by covalent bonds; undergo curing process during heating and shaping which causes permanent chemical change in molecular structure. Common materials include epoxy, silicone, polyurethane.
    (TLDR; material remains in a permanent solid state after being cured once).

> **Thermoplastics**: Linked by Van der Waals bonds; can be heated and reheated, reversible plastic operation

## Advantages & Disadvantages

### Thermoplastics

**Advantages**
    - Commonly used for aesthetic surface finishes
    - Recylability, end plastic part can be re-melted and formed into different shapes (commonly used for toys, furniture, etc.)
**Disadvantages:**
    - Ineffective for parts regularly exposed to extreme heat or rapidly varying temperature ranges as they can melt more easily.
    - Molding process requires higher heat (mold and melt temperatures) and pressure (leading to a larger press size) to create parts.

### Thermoset Plastics

**Advantages:**
    - Generally do not melt when exposed to heat
    - Do not deform, warp, or lose shape in varying temp. ranges
    - Molding process is cheaper as they require less complex tooling (i.e. far less heat and pressure → less complex tooling & press needed)
**Disadvantages:**
    - Much more difficult to surface finish
    - Cannot be remolded or reshaped
    - Poor thermal conductivity and rigidity

Plastics can be molded in several different ways, each of which have their unique strengths and weaknesses.
Common methods include injection molding, compression molding, and/or thermoforming.
