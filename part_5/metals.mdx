## What are Metals?

Metals are one of the four categories of engineering materials (other three are polymers, ceramics and composites).

The common properties of metals include:

- Ductility
- Strength
- Toughness
- Fatigue resistance
- Conductivity

## Metals you should know

**Iron** is one of the most important metals in engineering because it is used to create steel, a high-strength material that has a wide range of engineering applications.

**Aluminum** is another commonly used metal due to its high strength-to-weight ratios, low melting temperature, ease of processing and relatively low cost.

**Titanium** is even stronger than Aluminum and has excellent strength-to-weight properties, making it a popular choice for aerospace applications.

**Stainless Steel:**

## The molecular science of metals

The microstructure of metals at the atomic level is critical to understanding their properties. A pure metal has a closely packed atomic structure arranged in a regular grid called the crystal lattice, making it a crystalline material. The **packing of atoms in a crystal lattice gives metals their high density** compared to other materials.

ðŸ’¡ **Fun fact (probably wonâ€™t get asked in interview)**: Different types of metals pack together in different ways, forming different crystal structures. Copper, for example, forms a **face-centered cubic (FCC) structure**, while iron forms a **body-centered cubic (BCC) structure**, and titanium forms a **hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure**.

**Dislocations move through the lattice by breaking and re-forming atomic bonds, causing plastic deformation in metals**. This motion of dislocations at the atomic level is irreversible, unlike the stretching of atomic bonds that causes elastic deformation, which is completely reversed when the load is removed. The density of dislocations affects the yield strength of a material, with a higher density of dislocations leading to improved strength due to dislocations tangling and preventing each other from moving through the lattice

## Cold-working

Cold working is a process of deforming metal at room temperature, which changes the mechanical properties of the material. **Cold working increases the strength, hardness, and durability of the metal, by increasing the number of dislocations**.

However, the process can also **cause the material to become more brittle**, which can lead to cracking and other failures if not managed properly.

Different methods of cold working include - **rolling, bending, and drawing.**

## Annealing

This is where annealing becomes helpful. Annealing is a heat treatment process that involves **heating a material (usually a metal) to a specific temperature and holding it there for a period of time, then allowing it to cool slowly**.

The purpose of annealing is to make the material **more ductile and less brittle, which can improve its overall toughness and reduce the likelihood of cracks or fractures** forming in the material. The process also helps to relieve internal stresses that may have built up in the material during the cold-working process.
