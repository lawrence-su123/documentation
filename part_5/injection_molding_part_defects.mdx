Even after designing your plastic parts correctly against DFM requirements and going through detailed mold flow, parts wonâ€™t mold perfectly at the beginning! Here are the common types of injection molding defects, and what the tooling vendor typically does to tune and fix the process.

### Sink Marks
Sink marks are one of the most common defects in injection molding. They are caused by the uneven cooling of the plastic material in the mold, resulting in a depression on the surface of the part. Sink marks can be prevented by adjusting the cooling time, increasing the mold temperature, and modifying the gate location.

### Flash
Flash is a thin layer of excess material that forms around the edges of the part during the injection molding process. It is caused by the material flowing into the small gap between the two halves of the mold. Flash can be prevented by reducing the injection pressure, increasing the clamping force, or modifying the gate location.

### Warping
Warping is a defect that occurs when the part is distorted or bent during the cooling process. This defect is caused by the uneven cooling of the plastic material, which can be prevented by modifying the gate location, increasing the cooling time, or adjusting the mold temperature.

### Short Shots
Short shots occur when the mold is not completely filled with plastic material, resulting in a part that is incomplete or missing certain features. This defect can be prevented by increasing the injection pressure, adjusting the injection speed, or modifying the gate location.

### Burn Marks
Burn marks are dark discolorations on the surface of the part, caused by the overheating of the plastic material in the mold. This defect can be prevented by reducing the injection temperature, increasing the cooling time, or modifying the gate location.

### Warpage
Flow lines are visible lines on the surface of the part, caused by the material flowing in different directions during the injection molding process. This defect can be prevented by adjusting the injection speed, increasing the mold temperature, or modifying the gate location.
