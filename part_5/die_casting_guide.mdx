## What is die-casting?
Die-casting is a manufacturing process used to produce **metal parts** with high precision and excellent surface finish.

It involves injecting molten metal, typically under high pressure and speed into a reusable steel mold, called a die, to form complex shapes.
The die is typically composed of two halves, the fixed half (core) and the movable half (cavity).

Most die-casting parts are made from non-ferrous metal alloys like Zinc, Copper, Aluminum, and Magnesium for example.

## Steps of Die-Casting

There are two variations of die-casting, primarily focused around the machine type. Both are available in horizontal or vertical machine configurations.

### Hot Chamber Casting
In hot chamber casting, the furnace is integrated directly in the press machine. The metal alloy is melted in the furnace portion of the machine, and the motlen alloy is injected under high pressure into the die.

### Cold Chamber Casting
In cold chamber casting, ingots are melted in a separate furnace as a pre-processing step before casting the part. A precise amount of molten alloy is transported to the short chamber, before injecting into the die under high pressure.

The table below describes pro's and con's to both methods.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

Casting is a process that can be dated back to over 6000 years ago! Any material that can be heated to a liquid state can be cast under gravity, or under high pressure. As a modern manufacturing technique, die-casting offers advantages like:

### Advantages
1. High efficiency (multi-cavity tools and fast cycle times)
2. Good surface finish and dimensional consistency
3. Able to produce complex geometric parts with thin thicknesses

### Disadvantages
1. Small amount of porosity from process limitations (can affect cosmetics on surface finish and/or result in weaker, structural parts)
2. Shorter tool life when casting with high melting point alloys (Cu/ Ferrous metals)
