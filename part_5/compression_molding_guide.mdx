## What is compression molding?

Compression molding is a process of molding in which a preheated thermoset material (typically referred to as *******charge*******) is placed in a heated mold cavity, and then compressed under high pressure until it conforms to the shape of the mold. The mold is then cooled, and the molded part is ejected.

It’s a relatively simple process where two heated molds compress under pressure to create the desired form!

### Steps of Compression Molding:

1. Preparing the material: A known volume of thermoset material is preheated to a specific temperature in the center of the bottom mold.
    1. If there’s too much charge, excess material will flow out of the mold (i.e. ******flash******) and result in post-process trimming steps.
2. Placing the material: The preheated material is placed in the mold cavity, and the mold is closed.
3. Applying pressure: The mold is subjected to high pressure, typically ranging from 5000 to 10,000 psi, to compress the material into the shape of the mold.
4. Cooling and ejection: The mold is then cooled, and the molded part is removed

## How is compression molding different from injection molding?

Both are very similar, but have a couple of major differences! Compression molding is used to manufacture **thermosetting plastic parts**, while injection molding is used to manufacture **thermoplastic parts**.

In terms of processing, in compression molding the molds close around the charge, while in injection molding the charge is injected into the closed mold cavity.

Let’s compare their pro’s and cons:

| Process | Advantages  | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Injection Molding | 1. Able to mold highly complex, plastic parts with multiple undercuts, side actions.
2. Shorter cycle time
3.  Generally better suited for high-volume production | 1. High tooling costs
2. Not suitable for low volume production runs
3. Complex tooling costs, long lead times  |
| Compression Molding  | 1. Use for relatively simple designs (i.e. large basic shapes that can’t be extruded)
2. Cost-effective (lower-pressure production method, lower tooling costs)
3. Generally better suited for low to medium part production runs  | 1. Longer cycle times (minutes vs. seconds)
2. Does not work well for complex parts (slanted angles, small details)  |

The materials that can be used in compression molding can vary depending on the application, but typically include:

- Diallyl phthalate (DAP)
- Epoxy
- High-density polyethylene (HDPE)
- Melamine
- Polyamide-imides (PAIs)
- Polyether ether ketone (PEEK)
- Polyurethane (PU)
- Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS)
- Phenolic resins (PF)
- Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)

In general, any material that can be melted, softened, or chemically reacted under heat and pressure can potentially be used in compression molding. The suitability of a material for compression molding will depend on factors such as its viscosity, curing time, and moldability.

In our specific experiences working in industry, we’ve used compression molding for flexible elastomers with different durometer (i.e. hardness of material for rubbers) silicones and synthetic rubbers like EPDM (ethylene propylene diene terpolymer).
