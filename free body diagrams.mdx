## What is an FBD?

A free body diagram (FBD) is a visual representation of all the forces acting on an object in a given reference frame. We draw these forces out using arrows. The forces can include gravity, friction, tension, applied forces, etc.

### Static FBDs

In a static FBD, all of your forces add to 0, and your object of interest undergoes no motion as a result.

### Dynamic FBDs

In a dynamic FBD, your forces do not add to 0, and your object of interest can be characterized by equations of motion.

### Distributed vs Point load

A point load acts at a single point on an object (think about pressing an infinitely sharp pencil that won’t break against a wall).

A distributed load exerts distributed force along a length or area on an object.

## Review of common forces and moments you’ll deal with

### Gravitational force

This is the force exerted by a planet’s gravitational field on objects. It is a fundamental force and is responsible for the weight of objects. It is calculated by multiplying an object’s mass M by a gravitational constant g.

$$
F_{gravity}=Mg
$$

### Normal force

Normal force is the force exerted by a surface perpendicular to the object in contact with it. In other words, it is the force exerted by a surface that prevents an object from passing through it.

### Frictional force

Force between two surfaces that come into contact with each other and resist motion. Friction can be classified into two types: static friction and kinetic friction. A set of two materials has a kinetic and static frictional coefficient, which multiplies by the normal force between the two materials to arrive at the frictional force.

$$
F_{friction}=\mu F_{normal}
$$

### Centripetal force

Force that acts on an object moving in a circular path, directed towards the center of the circle. It is responsible for keeping the object in its circular path by continually changing its direction of motion towards the center of the circle.

The magnitude of the centripetal force required to keep an object moving in a circular path depends on the mass of the object, the speed at which it is moving, and the radius of the circle. The mathematical formula for calculating the centripetal force is:

<Latex>

F_{centripetal}= m\frac{v^2}{R}

</Latex>

where m is an object’s mass, v is its velocity, and R is the radius of its circular path of motion.

### Tension

Force resulting from an object that’s pulled or stretched by a force applied at opposite ends of the object.

### Compression

Force resulting from an object that’s compressed or pushed by a force applied at opposite ends of the object.

### Shear

Force resulting from two surfaces sliding past each other in opposite directions.

### Torsion

Torsion is a moment that is applied to twist an object along a central axis.

### Bending moment

Bending moment is a moment that is applied to bend an object, putting the part of an object above its neutral axis in tension and putting the part of an object below its neutral axis in compression.
