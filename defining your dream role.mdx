## Getting Started

Welcome to Hardware FYI Pro! Congratulations on taking this step towards reaching your dreams as a mechanical engineer.

The purpose of this program is not for you to log on and read a few of the pages, only to never sign back on in a few weeks.

<Check>
This program was designed to take you from ground zero to getting an internship/full-time job in 2-3 months.

It’s going to take active effort and commitment. But, to make your life easier and save you as much time as possible, we’ve designed this course to contain **the most useful and relevant information for recruitment.**

We’ve scoured textbooks, our own past interview notes, YouTube videos, online resources, and more to distill the most necessary, useful information into this one-stop-shop.

With that said, we hope you utilize this resource to the fullest and see the results you are looking for.
