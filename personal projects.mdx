Self-started projects are an amazing way to get serious hands-on experience and impress employers with detailed technical design & analysis.

<Tip>
Should personal projects go on your resume? **Absolutely.** Personal projects are a great way to leverage self-guided experiences to get jobs.
</Tip>

Here’s why:

1. **An easy portfolio project addition:** get your school credits while slapping another project on your portfolio—two birds with one stone!
2. ********Learn how to work on a team:******** so much of school is focused on the individual. With the constant pressure of your GPA hanging over your head, it’s easy to forget that team projects are an opportunity to build soft skills that will carry on with you for the rest of your career.

It’s important to learn how to work on a team—delegate tasks, drive meetings, and align with your teammates. At a company, you can’t do everything yourself, and you’re going to have to compromise with cross functional teams & work with difficult teammates. Start practicing early.
