## What is the stress strain curve?

The stress-strain curve is a fundamental concept in material science and engineering that describes the relationship between stress, which is the force applied per unit area, and strain, which is the deformation that results from the applied stress. By plotting the stress-strain curve for a given material, we can gain important insights into its mechanical properties, such as its **strength**, **ductility**, and **toughness**. The curve typically consists of several distinct regions, each of which represents different aspects of the material's behavior under stress. Understanding the stress-strain curve is critical for designing and testing materials, as well as for analyzing the behavior of structures under load. By analyzing this curve, engineers can make informed decisions about how to choose and utilize materials in a wide range of applications.

## Parts of the stress strain curve

The different regions of the curve are as follows:

1. **Elastic region:** In the elastic region, the material deforms linearly in response to applied stress. When the stress is removed, the material returns to its original shape. The slope of the curve in this region is known as the modulus of elasticity or Young's modulus.
2. **Yield point:** The yield point is the point on the curve where the material transitions from elastic deformation to plastic deformation. At this point, the material begins to deform permanently under stress.
3. **Plastic region:** In the plastic region, the material deforms plastically or permanently. The material will not return to its original shape when the stress is removed.
4. **Ultimate stress point:** The ultimate stress point is the point on the curve where the material reaches its maximum stress. After this point, the material will begin to fail.
5. **Fracture point:** The fracture point is the point on the curve where the material ruptures or breaks.

## Ductile vs brittle materials

Ductile, brittle, and tough are terms used to describe the behavior of materials under stress.

- **Ductile materials are able to undergo significant plastic deformation before fracturing.** This means that when subjected to force or pressure, they can stretch and bend without breaking. Examples of ductile materials include copper, aluminum, and steel. Ductility is an important property for materials that are subjected to bending or twisting, as it allows them to be formed into complex shapes. **********************Material C is ductile.**********************
- **Brittle materials, on the other hand, fracture without significant plastic deformation when subjected to stress.** This means that they are prone to breaking suddenly and without warning. Examples of brittle materials include glass, ceramics, and some types of metals, such as cast iron. Brittle materials are not desirable for applications where impact or sudden forces may be encountered. ********************************Material A is brittle.********************************
- **Tough materials are able to absorb energy without fracturing.** This means that they are able to withstand impacts and other sudden forces without breaking. Toughness is a combination of strength and ductility, and is an important property for materials used in applications where they are likely to encounter high stresses, such as in construction or manufacturing. Examples of tough materials include steel alloys, carbon fiber composites, and some types of plastics. **Toughness is quantified by the total area under the stress strain curve.** ****************************Material B is tough.****************************

**Relationships between these terms:**

A brittle material is not tough.

A ductile material MIGHT be tough, but wonâ€™t be if it has a low ultimate strength.

Tough materials are tough and ductile.

## True Stress & Strain vs Engineering Stress & Strain

The stress-strain curve is a fundamental tool used to analyze the mechanical behavior of materials under loading. It provides important information about the strength, ductility, and other mechanical properties of materials. In this context, there are two commonly used methods of measuring stress: engineering stress and true stress.

Engineering stress is defined as the force applied to a material divided by its original cross-sectional area. It is a convenient and widely used method of measuring stress, but it assumes that the cross-sectional area remains constant during deformation, which is not always the case. As a result, the engineering stress-strain curve may not accurately reflect the true mechanical behavior of a material, especially at high strains or stresses.

True stress, on the other hand, takes into account the change in cross-sectional area of a material during deformation. It is defined as the force applied to a material divided by its instantaneous cross-sectional area. The true stress-strain curve is therefore more accurate than the engineering stress-strain curve, especially at high strains or stresses. The true stress-strain curve is also steeper than the engineering stress-strain curve, indicating that the material is actually stronger than what the engineering stress-strain curve suggests.

In practical terms, the difference between true stress and engineering stress is often negligible for small strains, but becomes more significant as the strain increases. At high strains, the engineering stress-strain curve may significantly underestimate the true strength of the material, leading to inaccurate predictions of material failure.

## Strain Hardening

Strain hardening, also known as work hardening or cold working, is a process by which a **metal becomes stronger and harder as it is deformed**. This happens because the **deformation causes dislocations in the crystal lattice of the metal**, which hinder the motion of other dislocations, making it more difficult for them to move and causing them to pile up.

**This effect is apparent in the stress strain curve from locations 2 to 4 in the graph above (from yield to ultimate stress).**
