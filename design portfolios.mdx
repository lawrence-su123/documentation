## What is an engineering design portfolio?

A portfolio is a collection of the engineering projects you‚Äôve worked on throughout your academic and professional career! Think of it as a way to visually showcase your skillset to employers, and document any and all sorts of projects you‚Äôve worked on in the past.

I can‚Äôt **overemphasize** how useful it is to create your own engineering design portfolio. From our own experiences, we‚Äôve often substituted writing a cover letter (general rule of thumb: you don‚Äôt need them) and submitted our design portfolios instead.

<Note>
When I was struggling to land interviews my junior year of college, I changed my approach from online applications to cold emailing and attaching my design portfolio in each of the messages. Within weeks, I was scheduled for 10-15+ interviews I previously didn‚Äôt have with companies like Apple, Tesla, and smaller start-ups.

TLDR; Start making your design portfolio now!

## Where to Host Portfolios

If you‚Äôre unsure of how to get started, design portfolios can take many shapes and forms:

1. Personal website (hosted through Wix, SquareSpace, or personal portfolio templates hosted on Github)
- Here are some examples below of well-designed portfolios by college undergraduates:
    - [Clayton Haight | Projects](https://clayhaight.com/projects)
    - [Home](https://www.brianmach.com/home)
    - [Jaideep Singh Chavan](https://jaideepsingh08.github.io/)
    - [Benjamin Chia](https://bjchia.github.io/)

2. Presentation PDF‚Äôs
    - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JVNYYBTPuoYD9G-F_orVi0VaoZwB85cH/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JVNYYBTPuoYD9G-F_orVi0VaoZwB85cH/view)

1. 1-2 Page PDF/Word Document:

If you‚Äôre looking for the lowest entry of barrier to get started, there are website designed to host and share design portfolios. Check out [Skilldeck](https://www.skilldeck.io/) & [Brinkfolio](https://www.brinkfolio.io).

<Tip>
Handy trick: if you ever have the opportunity to go to a career fair, print out a copy of your portfolio form to showcase your work to recruiters and engineers in real time. In a room full of text-filled resumes, you‚Äôll stand out significantly from the crowd!

Companies at career fairs often schedule interviews directly afterwards or during the fair, so it‚Äôs a great way to push your name/reputation forward.

## Design Portfolio Structure:

1. **Identify your design projects:**
    - These could be projects you‚Äôve completed in school, at an internship, or on your own time. Choose projects that demonstrate your skills and abilities and that showcase a range of techniques and technologies.
        - If you‚Äôre struggling to think of projects to highlight, projects from school are great to showcase! Prospective employers don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve worked on in class, so you should highlight it when you don‚Äôt have relevant job experience. Machine shop and CAD projects work great.
2. **Gather your design files:**
    - Once you‚Äôve identified the projects you want to showcase, gather all the design files related to each project. These could include drawings, sketches, calculations, simulations, CAD models, and any other relevant documentation.
3. **Organize your files:**
    - Organize your design files into a logical structure that makes it easy for potential employers to navigate your portfolio.
    - For each project, include a summary of the project goals, the techniques and technologies used, and your role in the project. This will provide context for potential employers and help them understand your capabilities.
        - Include images and renderings of your design work to showcase your skills and abilities. This could include CAD models, simulation results, or prototype photos.
4. **Create a cover page:**
    - Include your name, contact information, and a brief introduction to yourself and your skills. This is the first page potential employers will see, feel free to get creative!

## If you take away nothing else‚Ä¶

<Note>
üì∏ The best portfolios are full of great pictures

</Note>

Most recruiters and engineers do not have the time to parse through each project‚Äôs technical details.

It‚Äôs still important to tell the story of your project, but a picture can convey a lot very quickly.

To do this, the easiest way to format your portfolio is in the form of a website wall of project photos (see below).

This wall is the first thing anyone will see, so it‚Äôs important to use the best pictures you have here.

Each photo links to a detailed project explanation, where someone can read about a project if they are intrigued by the image.
