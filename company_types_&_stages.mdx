On the previous page, we discussed core factors that are a large % of what defines your dream. There's another element that doesn't get as much attention, namely the **stage of company.** This can make/break your job satisfaction at a company.

[Nikhyl Singhal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhyl/), serial entrepreneur and VP of Product at Meta, wrote a eye-opening post that took us years of trial-and-error at Hardware FYI to help us define where we wanted to work.

We'll digest what this means for you in your own job search.

Jobs consumer a 1/3 of your time in a single day (at a minimum!). Choosing where you work is important regardless the stage of career.

As college students, we often find ourselves pondering the daunting question of which company to join once we step into the professional world. While considerations like workplace culture, co-workers, and compensation are important, there is one crucial factor that often goes unnoticed: the stage of development of the company itself. Understanding the different stages can make or break your career leap. In this blog post, we will explore the four stages of company development and how they can impact your career choices.

Pre-product Fit Companies:
Imagine a company in its early days, still figuring out whether people even want their product. These pre-product fit companies are all about experimentation, fast fails, and operational scrappiness. This stage is ideal for entrepreneurs and risk-takers who thrive in uncertainty and embrace change. While joining a company at this stage can be risky, it can also lead to life-changing experiences if the product finds its market fit.

Post-product Fit Companies:
After years of experimentation, some companies finally find something that works. These post-product fit companies need stability and structure to protect their newly discovered success. They require functional experts who can introduce the right amount of structure and process without stifling the founders' vision. If you prefer a more structured environment and enjoy being part of the team that ensures stability and growth, this stage might be the right fit for you.

Growth Companies:
Growth companies are a rarity, as only a few make it to this stage. These companies are experiencing explosive demand for their products and are rapidly expanding their customer base and product lines. It's an exhilarating and chaotic time, full of innovation and ambiguity. Resilient individuals who thirst for change and are comfortable with navigating through uncertainties can find great opportunities here. However, be aware that hypergrowth can also introduce challenges and anxieties within the company.

Scaled Companies:
Think of big tech giants like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. These companies have established themselves as market leaders and are known for their success and longevity. Scaled companies have a finely tuned process for operating at scale, layers of successful management, and a wide range of products. Joining such a company offers stability, benefits, and brand recognition. However, it may be challenging to make a significant impact or influence company decisions at this stage.

Finding Your Fit:
It's important to understand that each stage of company development is unique and offers different opportunities and challenges. Consider your own preferences and working style when choosing the right stage for your career:

If you appreciate structure and stability, stages 2 and 4 may be the best fit for you.
If you thrive in dynamic, ever-changing environments, stages 1 and 3 could be more suitable.
If you enjoy introducing processes at scale and want to be part of market dominance, both growth and scaled companies can provide opportunities.
Conclusion:
As college students, it's crucial to have a holistic understanding of the stages of company development when embarking on your professional journey. Experiencing all four stages throughout your career can help you develop a diverse skill set, determine where you fit best, and maximize your chances for impact and earnings. Remember to consider the stage that aligns with your goals, preferences, and working style when searching for your next job. Choose wisely and enjoy the exciting adventure that awaits you in the professional world!
