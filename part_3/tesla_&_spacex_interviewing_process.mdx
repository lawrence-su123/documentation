Tesla interviews are generally very technical. Be ready to answer basic textbook problems on the spot. It can be hard to anticipate the types of questions given you don't know what team you're interviewing for but I'd review some basic equations for statics and material properties. They will probably also ask about projects you've worked on and maybe even ask you to apply those equations to your project. Have an idea of what project you'd want to talk about. A general interview tip but especially for Tesla, have a strategy to break down a hard problem where you don't know where to start.
