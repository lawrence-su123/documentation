## Standard Interviewing Format:

Apple's interview process is notoriously known for being long and technically challenging. You'll face several rounds of interviews and assessments throughout
the process.

<Info>
**Public Service Announcement (PSA)**

Technical depth varies quite a bit depending on the specific role. This guide is tailored toward the Product Design Engineer positions.

Other roles you could interview for include Manufacturing Quality, Manufacturing Design, or Technical Program Management (TPM) roles. Expect more of a manufacturing focus for the 1st two roles, and a focus
on project-management capabilities for TPM roles.

### 1st Round Screen
For PD Engineering interviews, the first round with be a technical phone screen.
Be prepared to focus on core mechanical engineering fundamentals like:
1. Cantilever Beam Bending
2. Stress & Strain
3. Heat Transfer

Prep for these types of questions by reading Cracking the ME Technical Interview section and reviewing common questions on the [Hardware FYI Forum](https://www.hardwareinterviews.fyi/tag/apple).

### Design Challenge
If you pass the technical phone screen (1st round), you'll be given a design challenge to test your intuition in in solving design problems. Here's an excerpt from a [former Apple Engineer](https://instrumental.com/resources/uncategorized/how-to-interview-a-product-design-engineer/) on
the types of design challenges you could encounter:

> Challenge #1: Apple iPod / Watch PD famously uses a battery door design challenge, so in addition to doing it myself back in 2009, I’ve also seen many 10s of them during my time at Apple.
>
> The prompt is to design a battery door that uses a push-push mechanism. What makes this difficult and creates a spread among candidates is really in how he or she approaches and defends the resulting design. A candidate who considers material selection, manufacturability, assembly complexity, part cost, system and part reliability (including test plan and quantities), and (because it’s Apple) cosmetics is going to do well, even if it’s unclear that the design will work.
>
> Challenge #2: Pick an important sub-system of your product that your new hire will need to get right – such as a water-sealed enclosure. There’s many ways to solve this problem, but you’ll want to look at the details.
>
> Did the candidate consider cost, reworkability, manufacturability, design complexity, materials, reliability testing, and cosmetics? For example, if the candidate used an o-ring gasket, is the groove designed such that added pressure actually makes the seal better? Is there even compression all of the way around?


As a general note, **stick to the prompt** and do not deviate from the requirements!. Even if you cannot “successfully” complete it, do not waiver from the base requirements. The manager will usually have you send the presentation a few days before you present it to make sure you’ve included everything they want to see.

Check out the example linked [here](https://issuu.com/marcelokoli/docs/apple_design_challenge) for a design challenge on the battery door.

### On-Site Interview (Full Day)

The on-site interview will consist of multiple 1:1's (anywhere from 3 to 6 different engineers) over the entire day. You'll be asked a variety of questions that are both behavioral and
technical in nature.

Review common questions you'll encounter on the [Hardware FYI Forum](https://www.hardwareinterviews.fyi/tag/apple), expect to defend design decisions made
in the design challenge prompt, and know your past projects well.

### Call with Director of Engineering

If you've made it this far, it's a great sign! This is primarily a formality for cultural fit and assessing why you want to work at Apple.

After this call, expect a hiring decision to be made shortly.
