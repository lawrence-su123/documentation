To understand the interviewing process, it's essential to see it from the employer's point of view. It's not just candidates who find the process
stressful, employers find it to be a grueling process too!

<Note>
**Employer's Standpoint:**

It's expensive for companies to find the right candidate, stressful for hiring managers, and monotonous at times for interviewers.
If you're nervous going into interviews, just remember that these are just human interactions! At the end of the day, it's a conversation you're having with a mix
of individuals.

## Important Signals in a Candidate

The goal of the company during the interview process is to understand whether the candidate has the correct skills/aptitude needed to do the job, and if they find you to be
a correct fit within their existing organizational structure. It's a mix of both **technical and non-technical skills** that signal to a hiring manager they've found the correct candidate
to extend an offer.

The mix of technical and soft skills changes depending on the company you're interviewing with.
Companies like Neuralink, SpaceX, & Apple lean heavily on assessing technical knowledge during the process. You'll find a heavy dose of technical interviews, design challenges, and presentations.

On the flip side,start-ups care much more about cultural fit as each hire they
make carries a disproportionate impact on the team due to size.




talk about how expensive it is to fill roles, hours committed, it's an expensive process.

### Early in Process
 early in the process, we often need to just reduce the volume because there are too many candidates to even consider. That‚Äôs part of what automatic assessments are for, but there will also be some arbitrary filters. And because we query databases with result limits, it can literally be down to random luck.


### Unsure Where to Chunk
Best advice I‚Äôve seen thus far is simple: ‚ÄúEach interview is learning experience, just focus at learning, results are byproduct.‚Äù

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the mindset you need to have before, during, and after each interview. I glaze over when people describe how ‚Äúpro-active,‚Äù ‚Äúa team player,‚Äù or even ‚Äúresults-oriented‚Äù they are (and definitely don‚Äôt drone on about how you want to ‚Äúadd value‚Äù). All of that can mean a million things, which makes it meaningless.

What does get my attention is someone who‚Äôs 100% present in the conversation or on the task at hand. I‚Äôm not looking for timed monologues, I‚Äôm looking for someone who listens to the question being asked and understands what specific thing I‚Äôm trying to evaluate. It isn‚Äôt hard, but it requires focus and clarity in your thinking and communication.

Technical ability is only half of it. We look for people who are good communicators, open to feedback, conscientious, highly collaborative, and who take a long view when making decisions. People who can unblock themselves, and who recognize the value in trying things and are pragmatic about moving forward without all the information when the cost of failure is low. I also look for people who are comfortable with not knowing things and who can admit it, and who trust their own ability to learn what they don‚Äôt know quickly.




### Important Qualities in a Candidate
not in any particular order:

Attitude - someone who is clearly ready to jump right in, and prepared to start learning what they need to learn right away. Side note: asking good questions when it's your turn to ask the interviewers questions shows a good attitude. Don't just come up with bullshit questions, have some idea about what you want to ask the interviewers.

Aptitude - while you can train a developer in any language if they already know how to program, having existing knowledge on at least one of the components of our stack is a huge plus. Real experience with it is an even bigger plus. If you are experienced in other languages or frameworks but not the ones we are using, it's not an automatic rejection, but if we have another candidate that does have that experience, they will probably be ranked higher than you.

Portfolio - this mostly matters for front-end, since it's hard to show off many other kinds of work. But having a GitHub or equivalent is helpful. Pinning some of the repos you want to highlight on your profile helps more; I can focus on those instead of trying to find repos that show your skills.

Testing - most interviews I've participated in will involve some kind of coding test. Often it's just a "prove you aren't lying about being able to code" kind of test; a FizzBuzz or Factorial question. But sometimes it goes further. One of my favorites was to ask a candidate to write a function that takes a string and returns true if the string has "balanced" parenthesis (i.e. for every ( there is a ), and no ) that didn't have a ( before it). And whether you actually get to the answer isn't quite as important as us seeing your process for getting there. If you just stare at the screen for a while and throw your hands up, you probably aren't the candidate for us. If you try things, talk out what your thought process is, and explain to us what you're trying, then even if your answer isn't perfect, we can at least understand that you are approaching it correctly.





If you think one interview goes poorly, don‚Äôt despair. There are many random variables other than your actual performance
that influence the outcome of an interview: the questions asked, other candidates the interviewer has seen before you,
after you, the interviewer‚Äôs expectation, even the interviewer‚Äôs mood. It is, in no way, a reflection of your ability or
your self-worth. Companies know that too, and it‚Äôs a common practice for companies to invite rejected candidates to interview
again after a year or so.

üå≥ Tip üå≥
Job descriptions are for reference. Apply for jobs you like even if you don't have all the skills and experiences in the job descriptions. Chances are you don't need them for those jobs.
</Tip>

This also contributes to why employee experience varies so wildly from team to team, geo to geo. Finding a good fit is critical and effortful, but the payoff is well worth it if you do (in terms of both money and personal growth). If you‚Äôre qualified and determined enough, it‚Äôs not as hard or complicated to ace the interview as people seem to think.
