An Email to a Recruiter/Hiring Manager:
> ✉️ Subject line: Opportunities with <*Company Name*>
>
> Hi `Name`,
>
> I came across your information after looking more into `company`. I've known about`company` for some time now and I love the products you've helped create. Oftentimes I feel that design is neglected in hardware engineering but your company does a seamless job of translating industrial design into tangible engineering (`sentence describing why you're interested in the company/role)`. As you handle recruiting, I wanted to reach out directly to you.
>
> I graduated from `school` majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering and worked prior internships at companies like `school/company`, `school/company`, `school/company`. To put it shortly, I have experience in manufacturing, consumer product design, mechanical testing, and mechatronics (add relevant `skills` you have).
>
> I attached my resume and design portfolio for reference. If you could help push my material in the right direction, that would be greatly appreciated.

> Thanks,
