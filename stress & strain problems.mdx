## Question #1: ## Stretchy shoes
 `beginner`

**Problem**

**Part 1:**

Draw the stress strain curves for Aluminum, Steel, Rubber, and Plastic (doesn’t need to be exact)

**Part 2**

Let’s say you apply a load on the aluminum piece beyond yield up to point B (shown below). How does the strain vary as you relax this load?

**Part 3 (this one is harder)**

Say you reapply load, but now you load to up to the ultimate stress. Draw the stress strain curve for this reapplication of load to the same material.

### Solution

## Question #2:Super-boxer
`intermediate`

**Problem**

To decide which one to use, you subject both rods to a tensile test and plot their respective stress-strain curves.

The stress-strain curves for material A and B are shown below:

You know that your gloves need to be tough enough to cause plastic deformation in the robot with your punches, so you need to choose the material that is tougher. Which material should you use to make your superhero gloves?

### Solution

To determine which material is tougher, we need to consider the amount of energy required to cause permanent deformation. This is represented by the area under the stress-strain curve.

From the stress-strain curves, we can see that material B requires more energy to undergo plastic deformation than material A. This is because the area under the curve for material Q is greater than the area under the curve for material A. Therefore, we can conclude that material B is tougher than material A. Don’t be fooled by the fact that material A has a higher ultimate stress!

As a superhero, toughness is a crucial property for your gloves because it allows you to punch the robot with enough force to cause plastic deformation and weaken its structure. With gloves made of material B, you can confidently take down the robot and save the city from destruction.

## Question #3: N/A `advanced`

**Part 1**

Let’s say you’re designing a robot with the capability of picking ad
