shelby notes:

So my process was:
1-call with manager
2-design challenge (2 weeks time then presentation to team)
3-6 1:1s over a 4 hour period
4-call with director (formality)

For the call with the manager and the 1:1s there are many questions that you can find on Glassdoor that I followed and prepped for. This helped a lot. They truly do ask similar questions. However, my manager is a bit more understanding if I didn’t work on something. For example, springs. I hadn’t worked with them a lot so instead of diving deep into them he asked basic questions. It was nice, but not all managers are that lenient.
For the design challenge, STICK TO THE PROMPT. Do not deviate. Even if you cannot “successfully” complete it, do not waiver from the base requirements. The manager will usually have you send the presentation a few days before you present it to make sure you’ve included everything they want to see. This is helpful and make sure you send it to them to get tips.

Otherwise, be yourself, know your past projects well (however I didn’t need to show a portfolio or anything) and know WHY you want to work for Apple and answer those types of questions we’ll :)
Especially if you get to the call with the Director :)
