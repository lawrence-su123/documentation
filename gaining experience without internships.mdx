## Growth Hacking for Engineers
We’re big believers in learning by doing. As a mechanical engineer working in industry, theory can only take you so far! The real design process involves leveraging trial-and-error and rapid prototyping.

The more you build, the better you get at engineering!
<Tip>
Don't have an internship lined up for the summer? Try building a project you've always been interested in!
It could be an electric skateboard, electric bike, woodworking, anything. Just start building.
</Tip>


For those starting out, we've identified three common ways to gain experience without necessarily having an internship or full-time job.

## Project Oriented Coursework
While most academic engineering majors have a large focus on theory (which is still very important!), **we recommend that you take the opportunity to take as many project-oriented classes as possible.**

<Tip>
The sooner you take project-oriented classes, the more material you can add to your resume.
</Tip>

Here’s why:

1. **An easy portfolio project addition:** get your school credits while slapping another project on your portfolio—two birds with one stone!
2. ********Learn how to work on a team:******** so much of school is focused on the individual. With the constant pressure of your GPA hanging over your head, it’s easy to forget that team projects are an opportunity to build soft skills that will carry on with you for the rest of your career.

It’s important to learn how to work on a team—delegate tasks, drive meetings, and align with your teammates. At a company, you can’t do everything yourself, and you’re going to have to compromise with cross functional teams & work with difficult teammates. Start practicing early.

### Course Suggestions
Here are examples of project-oriented classes common in all undergraduate ME programs:

<Info>
Not all schools assign the same name to the classes listed below. Read the syllabus and get tips from upperclassmen on which classes were particularly helpful!
</Info>

1. Computer Graphics in Design
    - Course that focuses on teaching you how to use CAD software (most commonly Solidworks for undergraduate programs).
2. Manufacturing Processes
    - Hands-on class that teaches common fabrication techniques. Involves the use of your school's prototyping lab
3. Mechanical Design
4. Mechatronics
5. Senior Design
    - Course with a capstone project that acts as a culmination of your undergraduate degree. Depending on the school/particular major, you could be partnering with real companies, small businesses, or research labs on campus!


## Personal Projects

Not all learning happens in the construct of academic settings or jobs. Quite often, the best engineers you'll meet developed their skills simply by working on passion projects.

Personal projects act as a playground where you can dive into real-world challenges, test your knowledge, and push the boundaries of your current abilities.
Personal projects provide a significant boost to your profile, making you a more intriguing candidate to employers.

Why do you say that?
1. Demonstrate passion and initiative:  
2. Showcase technical skills:
2. Differentiate from other candidates:

Demonstrate passion and initiative, showcase technical skills,
By taking the initiative to embark on personal projects, you'll experience a multitude of benefits:

They provide a playground for experimentation, foster independent learning, and cultivate collaboration and communication.

In the competitive landscape of engineering, it takes more than just a degree to stand out. Employers seek candidates with a passion for learning, problem-solving abilities, and a knack for innovation. One powerful way to showcase these qualities is through personal projects. These projects not only enhance your engineering skills but also make an impressive addition to your resume. In this blog post, we'll explore the transformative potential of personal projects, delving into how they ignite your engineering prowess and elevate your professional profile.

Personal projects can provide a signifant boost to your profile, making you a more intriguing candidate to employers.
