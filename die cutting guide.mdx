### What is Die Cutting?

Die-cutting is a process of cutting or shaping materials using a specially designed tool called a die. This tool is typically made of steel and has a sharp edge that is used to cut or stamp shapes into various materials such as paper, cardboard, fabric, and metal. The process of die-cutting is commonly used in the printing and packaging industry to create custom shapes, designs, and logos on various products.

### How does Die Cutting Work?

Die-cutting is achieved by placing the material to be cut on a flat surface and then pressing the die down onto it with a machine known as a die cutter or press. The die cutter applies pressure to the die, which then cuts or shapes the material according to the design of the die. The process can be used to create a variety of shapes and sizes, from simple circles and squares to complex designs with intricate details.

One of the benefits of die-cutting is that it allows for precise and consistent cuts, making it ideal for mass production. Die-cutting is commonly used in the production of items such as packaging boxes, labels, foams, and consumer product applications (think like foam seals) where uniformity and accuracy are crucial.

Die-cutting can be done manually or with the use of machines, depending on the complexity of the design and the volume of the production. Manual die-cutting is usually done with hand-held tools, such as scissors or rotary cutters. On the other hand, machine die-cutting is done with a die-cutting press or a computerized cutting machine, which allows for faster and more accurate production. For faster cycle times and a larger upfront investment in tooling costs, rotary die-cut machines can output a high quantity of parts!
