## The two methods of cold outreach

Cold outreach is an incredibly powerful tool for individuals eager to embark on their engineering journey. When utilized effectively, it can open doors and provide valuable opportunities for growth.

> 👨‍💻 “In my fall quarter of college during junior year, I applied primarily through online applications and struggled to land interviews. The moment I started reaching out to recruiters/hiring managers directly through cold emails, my applications started receiving more attention and I secured 10x more interest.“

There are two primary methods of cold outreach that you can use to connect with engineers in your desired field or company.

### Mass Outreach

**Use for: job referrals, connecting directly to hiring managers + recruiters**

The first method of cold outreach involves sending out a large number of messages to engineers without doing extensive research. The primary goal is to generate a high volume of responses, which can be useful if you are looking for immediate job opportunities. This method is best for those who are seeking rapid results and are less concerned with building long-term relationships.

### **Targeted Outreach**

**Use for: general career & life advice (how did`individual` end up in `role/company`?**

The second approach to cold outreach is more targeted and involves doing your research to find someone whose career path you would like to emulate. Take the time to learn about their work, such as published papers or online portfolios, and craft a personalized message that expresses your genuine curiosity.

“_You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you._”
</Tip>
This method may take longer to yield results, but it allows you to build a genuine connection with someone who could become a valuable mentor. This approach is the most fulfilling and less transactional because it comes from a place of authentic curiosity, and not just a desire to achieve a specific outcome.

Roughly ~1.5 years after college, I started working at my dream start-up due to the conversations I had years prior. Forming genuine connections through cold outreach will pay dividends over time.”*

**Remember…**

Regardless of which approach you choose, it's essential to remember that the most valuable thing you can offer as a student is your undivided attention and genuine curiosity.

With Mass Outreach:

When applying to jobs and looking for a referral, don’t be afraid to pitch yourself and talk about your achievements. Remember, the end goal is to bypass the mass amount of applicants and get a referral directly from a recruiter/engineer working internal to the company!

With Targeted Outreach:

Remember that this should come from a place of genuine interest! Engineers are not recruiters, so avoid trying to sell yourself or talk too much about your achievements. Instead, listen carefully, ask thoughtful questions, and be sure to follow up with a thank-you email.

### How do I find people to cold email?

With today’s tools, it’s surprisingly easy to reach out to almost any individual you’re interested in meeting with. All it takes is a bit of initiative and using the right tools!

- LinkedIn: Search for companies, job titles, people with 1st-3rd degree connections, and/or similar college affiliations as a starting point
    - MAYBE ADD GIF HERE SHOWING THIS
- College Alumni Network
- Student Organizations (FSAE, engineering societies, etc.)

Once you’ve found contacts you want to reach out to, the following email finder tools web-scrape to match the contact name with business email domains:

1. [RocketReach - Find email, phone & social media for 450M+ professionals](https://rocketreach.co/)

2. [ Clearbit Connect](https://clearbit.com/resources/tools/connect)

3. [Hunter (Email Hunter)](https://hunter.io/)

## Templates

While we don’t believe you need to follow any set format, here are a few templates and examples of emails you can send for different situations.

**Step 1: Initial Outreach Templates:**

An Email Template to Recruiters/Hiring Managers:
> Subject line: Opportunities with 'Company Name'
>
> I came across your information after looking more into 'company'. I've known about 'company' for some time now and I love the products you've helped create. Oftentimes I feel that design is neglected in hardware engineering but your company does a seamless job of translating industrial design into tangible engineering ('sentence describing why you're interested in the company/role'). As you handle recruiting, I wanted to reach out directly to you.
>
> I graduated from school majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering and worked prior internships at companies like school/company, school/company, school/company. To put it shortly, I have experience in manufacturing, consumer product design, mechanical testing, and mechatronics (add relevant skills you have).
>
>I attached my resume and design portfolio for reference. If you could help push my material in the right direction, that would be greatly appreciated.
>
> Thanks,

An Email Template to Engineers:
> Subject line: Interested learning more about 'Recipient’s career'
>
> Hi 'Name',
>
> My name is 'XYZ' and I’m currently 'student/role' at 'school/company'. I’m reaching out because I’m interested in your work at 'company'. If you are willing, I’d love to hop on a call with you to learn more about your day to day at work and what kinds of projects you’ve been able to own during your tenure.
>
> I’ve attached my resume and portfolio below.
>
> Thank you, and looking forward to hearing back!

**Step 2: Follow-up Template:**

From what I’ve discovered, the percentage of getting a response back from a cold outreach inquiry is typically much lower on the 1st email. To prevent your application from being lost in a sea of emails, I’ll typically follow-up 3 to 4 days later with a short message like below.

We’ve found this to be highly successful at Hardware FYI.

> Hi 'Name',
>
> Just wanted to gently bump this to the top of your inbox. Hope you have a great week.
>
> Best,
> Your Name

It's that simple! A bit of human touch and a small nudge go a long way.

**Step 3: Thank You Email Template:**

It’s important to be respectful as the other party is the one helping you out! ALWAYS write a thank you email, and make sure to reference specific points of conversation that stood out to you.

> Subject line: Thank you
>
> Hi Name
>
> Thank you for taking the time to chat today. It was wonderful to meet you!
>
> I really enjoyed our conversation, especially the piece about Interesting topic that you’ve discussed
>
> I’m very excited about this opportunity, looking forward to hearing more about next steps. If there’s anything I can provide from my end, don’t hesitate to ask!
>
> Best,
> Your Name
