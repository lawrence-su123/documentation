## To find your dream job…

It’s important to know where you’re going before you set out to do anything.

That’s why it’s extremely important to write out your goal, in terms of what you are looking for in a full time mechanical engineering job.

## Key Criteria:

What does your dream job look like in terms of your:


>👩‍💼 Coworkers? *Depending on the age and total headcount of a company, you’ll see a range of work relationships from personable/friendly to strictly professional.*

>🏢 Work culture & environment? How important is work-life balance to you? Are you looking for lots of mentorship and a clear career trajectory, or enjoy working in ambiguity solving problems without clear solutions?

>🧤 Type of work? *Do you want your job to be hands-on, or do you want to spend lots of time doing CAD?*

>🌴 Location? Is there a preferable state or city you prefer to work in?

>💰 Salary? NGL, salary is always important. You should always argue for your competitive worth, we’ll dive deeper into this topic at the end of the guide.

**Write it down.**

## Types of companies
**Large industry giants**

👩‍💼 Typically working with older, more experienced engineers. You’ll run into people who’ve worked for 30+ years at a company, and know the ins and outs of every internal system known to mankind.

🏢 Generally, larger companies tend to have a solid work-life balance, since many of the engineers have families and many responsibilities outside of work. However, it’s also fairly common for the expectation that younger engineers will work more, so it really depends. From our experience, it is less common for you to be friends with your coworkers outside of work (not necessarily a bad thing!).

🧤Larger companies have the resources to invest into tons of resources, so you likely won’t be restricted by budget when you are designing prototypes or running design of experiments. On the flip side, you probably won’t be the actual person doing hands-on prototyping and tinkering. Typically, large companies invest in technicians and machinists who will do this for you.

🌴 Many larger companies, especially in the aerospace and automotive industries, are in remote, non-metropolitan areas (e.g. many automotive companies in the midwest). If you want to live in a city, it may be difficult to work at huge company, unless they happen to have a small office branch.

💰 At a large company, you’ll get paid a solid salary, and in tech it is common to also receive Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs.

**Startups**

👩‍💼Typically you’ll be working with a younger demographic, and people around your age who are looking to do exciting, fast-paced work. People on your team are likely going to be less experienced, although you will have a few senior/manager engineers with longer track-records in engineering.

🏢At a startup, you’ll likely be working much longer hours than you do at a large company (on average). As a result, you’ll probably end up becoming really good friends with your coworkers, since you’ll be working on a small team and seeing them often. The work will be intense as you’ll be responsible for more direct product contributions than at a large company, but you’ll learn at an exponential rate (check-out Chip Huyen’s guide about [7 reasons not to join a startup and 1 reason to](https://huyenchip.com/2021/02/27/why-not-join-a-startup.html#why_join_a_startup)).

  Chip Huyen once that joining startups is the only way to get 5 years of experience in 1 year. I couldn’t agree more.

🧤At a small company, you’re going to need to wear many hats. As a result, you won’t be diving as deep into each technical skill you learn, but you’ll be able to do the hands-on prototyping yourself and own a large chunk of a design (or perhaps even a whole product-line).

🌴Startups tend to be located in the city, to attract the best, young talent. If you want to walk to work and enjoy life in a city, a startup could be your best bet.

💰At a startup, you may or may not receive a salary as high as you would at a larger company (depends on a startup’s venture capital). You will also likely receive stock options, which are a high-risk high reward asset.

## Salary

There’s nothing wrong with wanting a high salary, and we argue that you should want one. With a comfortable salary, you are able to have surplus capital invest in yourself, so that you don’t have to compromise on your most important assets like time or health.
