We’re big believers in learning by doing. As a mechanical engineer working in industry, you’ll only be working with theory about 20% of the time. The real design process involves leveraging trial and error studies, design of experiments, and building/testing in the field. Basically trying stuff out.

While most of the mechanical engineering major is focused on theory, **we recommend that you take the opportunity to take as many project-oriented classes as possible.**

Here’s why:

1. **An easy portfolio project addition:** get your school credits while slapping another project on your portfolio—two birds with one stone!
2. ********Learn how to work on a team:******** so much of school is focused on the individual. With the constant pressure of your GPA hanging over your head, it’s easy to forget that team projects are an opportunity to build soft skills that will carry on with you for the rest of your career.

It’s important to learn how to work on a team—delegate tasks, drive meetings, and align with your teammates. At a company, you can’t do everything yourself, and you’re going to have to compromise with cross functional teams & work with difficult teammates. Start practicing early.
