We’re big believers in learning by doing. As a mechanical engineer working in industry, theory can only take you so far! The real design process involves leveraging trial-and-error, design of experiments, and iterative prototyping in the field. The more you build, the better you get at engineering.

While most academic engineering majors have a large focus on theory (which is still very important!), **we recommend that you take the opportunity to take as many project-oriented classes as possible.**

<Tip>
The sooner you take project-oriented classes, the more material you can add to your resume.
</Tip>

Here’s why:

1. **An easy portfolio project addition:** get your school credits while slapping another project on your portfolio—two birds with one stone!
2. ********Learn how to work on a team:******** so much of school is focused on the individual. With the constant pressure of your GPA hanging over your head, it’s easy to forget that team projects are an opportunity to build soft skills that will carry on with you for the rest of your career.

It’s important to learn how to work on a team—delegate tasks, drive meetings, and align with your teammates. At a company, you can’t do everything yourself, and you’re going to have to compromise with cross functional teams & work with difficult teammates. Start practicing early.

## Course Suggestions
Here are examples of project-oriented classes common in all undergraduate ME programs:

<Info>
Not all schools assign the same name to the classes listed below. Read the syllabus and get tips from upperclassmen on which classes were particularly helpfuL!
</Info>

1. Computer Graphics in Design
    - Class that teaches you how to use CAD software (most commonly Solidworks for undergraduate programs)
2. Manufacturing Processes
    - Hands-on class that teaches common fabrication techniques. Involves the use of your school's prototyping lab
3. Mechanical Design
4. Mechatronics
5. Senior Design
    - Capstone project to finish your undergraduate program. Depending on the school, you could be partnering with real companies, small businesses, or research labs on campus!

Most schools now also have start-up centers! Check-out their events to learn more, it's a great way to meet individuals with similar interests in building products.
