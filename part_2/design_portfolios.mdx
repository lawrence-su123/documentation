## What is a design portfolio?

A design portfolio is a visual representation of your work that complements your resume.
Think of it as a way to visually showcase your past work to employers, and document any and all sorts of projects you‚Äôve worked on in the past!

We cannot **overemphasize** how useful it is to create your own engineering design portfolio. From our own experiences, we‚Äôve often substituted writing a cover letter (general rule of thumb: you don‚Äôt need them) and submitted our design portfolios instead.

> When I was struggling to land interviews my junior year of college, I changed my approach from online applications to cold emailing and attaching my design portfolio in each of the messages.
> Within weeks, I was scheduled for **10-15+ interviews** I previously didn‚Äôt have with companies like Apple, Tesla, and smaller start-ups.
> **TLDR; Start making your design portfolio now!**

<Tip>
Handy trick: if you ever have the opportunity to go to a career fair, print out a copy of your portfolio form to showcase your work to recruiters and engineers in real time. In a room full of text-filled resumes, you‚Äôll stand out significantly from the crowd!

Companies at career fairs often schedule interviews directly afterwards or during the fair, so it‚Äôs a great way to push your name/reputation forward.

### Things to Collect

Anything that you've worked on in the past for a project (for a school class, engineering club, personal project, internship, etc.), start documenting everything now!

Your design portfolio can include items like:
1. CAD
2. 2-D Drawings, Napkin Sketches
3. Physical Prototypes
4. Calculations, Analysis
5. Block Diagrams
6. Testing Methodology

Anything that you think could be interesting to present, make sure to document it!

<Tip>
All of the below projects were part of undergraduate classes we took. Employers don't know what you've worked on, so show them through visual examples!

### Describing Projects
Organize your design files into a logical structure that makes it easy to follow. A timeless format that works well includes:

1. Summary of the project goals
2. Techniques and skills used
3. Role in the project

Include images and renderings of your design work to showcase your skills and abilities! Remember that this is a visual representation of work, pictures do speak 1000 words in this context.

### General Tips
- Cover Page: Include your name, contact information, and a brief introduction to yourself and your skills. This is the first page potential employers will see, feel free to get creative!
- The best portfolios are full of great pictures üì∏

<Note>

It may seem daunting to get started, but treat this as a fun exercise! A great portfolio takes time to develop as you gain more experience.
Just like your resume, treat your design portfolio as a living, breathing document.
</Note>


## Where to Host Portfolios

If you‚Äôre unsure of how to get started, design portfolios can take many shapes and forms. We've seen portfolios as presentations, personal websites, or even 1-2 page PDF's!
Choose your favorite medium and get started!

<Tip>
Personal websites can be hosted through [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/websites-start/?channel=pbr&subchannel=go&campaign=pbr-go-us-en-core_squarespacealone-e&subcampaign=(squarespace-alone_squarespace_e)&&cid=15698980512&aid=130361054086&tid=kwd-1988643730&mt=e&eid=&loc_p_ms=9031953&loc_i_ms=&nw=g&d=c&adid=571893406301&channel2=pbr&subchannel2=go&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwm4ukBhAuEiwA0zQxkwMSJEm92hFtiVsNXHTAXdL8BKrwT3air6PZbvEk3Isl6VVPsg95TxoCNZ0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), or on [Github](https://github.com/topics/personal-website).

### Design Portfolio Examples
Here are some design portfolios we've seen to help act as a starting point:
1. Website Based Portfolios
    - [Example #1](https://clayhaight.com/projects)
    - [Example #2 ](https://www.brianmach.com/home)
    - [Example #3](https://jaideepsingh08.github.io/)
2. Presentation Format:
    - [Example #1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JVNYYBTPuoYD9G-F_orVi0VaoZwB85cH/view)
3. 1-2 Page PDF/Word Document:
