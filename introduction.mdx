## A Quick Word

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to **Hardware FYI Pro**. This page is your go-to resource for hardware engineering recruiting. Hardware FYI is the result of the collective wisdom of many people who have sat on both sides of the table, and have spent a lot of time thinking about the hiring process for hardware engineers.

As a candidate, Iâ€™ve interviewed at over 75+ big companies and start-ups collectively. Iâ€™ve gotten offers for mechanical engineering roles at companies including Apple, Google, & Mill to name a few. Iâ€™ve also been rejected more times than I can fathom to remember. Over the course of 4+ years after founding [Hardware FYI](https://www.hardwareinterviews.fyi/), we have members that have landed their dream roles with Apple, Tesla, & SpaceX using our resource.

This program was designed to take you from ground zero to getting an internship/full-time job in 2-3 months.
