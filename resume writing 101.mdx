## Resume Structure

There’s no hard fast rules to writing a resume, but here’s a timeless structure to follow, from top to bottom of the page, in order.

1. ***Name (in BIG FONT), phone number, email**
2. **Brief headline**: what are you looking for in an internship or full-time opportunity?
3. **Education**: List your degree program, expected graduation date, and any relevant coursework, academic honors, or extracurricular activities.
4. **Professional experience**: Highlight any relevant work experience, such as internships, co-op positions, or part-time jobs. Include the company name, job title, dates of employment, and a brief description of your responsibilities and accomplishments.
5. **Extracurricular activities [optional]:** Include any relevant extracurricular activities, such as involvement in project teams like FSAE.
6. **Projects [optional]:** List any significant projects you have completed that are relevant to mechanical engineering, such as a class, research, or senior design project.
7. **Leadership and teamwork [optional]:** Showcase any leadership roles you have held or group projects you have worked on that demonstrate your ability to work well with others.
8. **Technical skills**: Include any technical skills that are relevant to mechanical engineering, such as proficiency in CAD software, knowledge of material science, or experience with design principles.


<Tip>
⚙️ Are you struggling to think of experience to put on your resume?

**Extracurricular clubs and engineering projects** are especially useful if you are a student** and only have one internship experience or none at all.

Don’t discount personal project and/or extracurricular experience; any engineering or design work you’ve put substantial effort into can land you a job!

## General guidelines

1. Keep your resume 1 page long
2. Use bullets, and make sure each bullet is less than one line long
3. Stick to a easy-to-read, professional font (i.e. Roboto, Times New Roman, etc.)
4. Keep it concise, and employ headings, margins, & spacing to make things easy to read
5. Tailor your resume — your headlines and even experiences/projects if you have enough to pick and choose from — to the job you apply to
    1. E.g. have one resume for aerospace & automotive companies, another for big tech companies, and another for startups.
6. Quantify your anything and everything possible in terms of what you’ve achieved- you are an engineer, so  let the numbers speak!

<Note>
> The best way to have a stellar resume is to read and emulate other great resumes.
> *“When I was in college and still today, I’d look online for individuals whose background & work experience I aspire to achieve (college upperclassmen, individuals who work at companies you’d like to be, etc.). I’d often study their resumes and LinkedIn profiles to understand their background and how they wound up in their current position.”*

## Resume Progression vs. Time

Talk about how resumes progress over time, it should be treated as a living, breathing document (look at hardwareishard.net post)
