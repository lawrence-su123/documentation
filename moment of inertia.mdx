## What is the Moment of Inertia?
In mechanical engineering, the **moment of inertia is a physical property of a rigid body that describes its resistance to rotational motion**. It is a measure of how difficult it is to change the rotational motion of an object.

To understand the moment of inertia, consider a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis. The moment of inertia is determined by the mass distribution of the object relative to the axis of rotation. **Specifically, it depends on both the mass of the object and the distance of the mass from the axis of rotation.** The farther away the mass is from the axis, the larger the moment of inertia.

Consider the classic example of a ballerina spinning. The ballerina will spin faster when moving her arms above her head, assuming her rotational energy remains constant. This is because she decreases her moment of inertia by doing so, and in order for energy to remain constant her angular velocity must increase.

## Bending

**In the context of bending, the moment of inertia refers to a physical property of a cross-sectional area of a beam or other structural member that describes its resistance to bending.** It is a measure of how difficult it is to bend the member and is determined by the mass distribution of the material in the cross-section relative to the neutral axis, which is the line in the cross-section that experiences no bending.

Mathematically, the moment of inertia of a cross-section can be calculated as the sum of the products of the area of each element in the cross-section and the square of its distance from the neutral axis, integrated over the entire cross-section. The greater the moment of inertia, the greater resistance to bending.

This is why an I-beam is is efficient at preventing bending. Consider two beam cross sections with the same area. The I-beam has more area further from the neutral axis, and because of this it is a more effective use of area in terms of increasing moment of inertia. From a cost perspective, the I beam can be stiffer than a square beam with the same amount of material used.
