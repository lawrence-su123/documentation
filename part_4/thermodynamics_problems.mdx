## Question #1: Solar Panel
`beginner`

**Problem**

A solar panel with an area of 1 m² is exposed to sunlight at a temperature of 100°C. The panel has a thermal conductivity of 20 W/mK and a thickness of 0.02 m. The back of the panel is in contact with a heat sink at a temperature of 20°C, which has a thermal conductivity of 100 W/mK and a thickness of 0.01 m. Assuming that the thermal resistances are in series, calculate the rate of heat transfer from the front of the solar panel to back of the heat sink.

**Solution:**

The thermal resistance of the solar panel can be calculated using the formula R = L / kA, where R is the thermal resistance, L is the thickness of the solar panel, k is the thermal conductivity of the solar panel, and A is the area of the solar panel.

Let’s calculate the solar panel and thermal sink heat resistance values.

## Question #2: Heated Rod
`intermediate`

**Problem:**

**Part 1**

An aluminum rod with diameter d is tightly wrapped in a cylinder of steel with diameter D. The rod and the cylinder are initially at the same temperature. What happens to the system when the temperature is increased?

************Part 2************

Let’s say you kept it at this temperature for an hour and let it cool slowly. Would the rod be stiffer before or after temperature application?

******Solution:******

**Part 1**

When the temperature of the system is increased, the aluminum rod and the steel cylinder undergo temperature-dependent strains due to their different coefficients of thermal expansion. The aluminum rod expands more than the steel cylinder for a given increase in temperature because it has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion. This causes the aluminum rod to push against the steel cylinder, creating a compressive stress in the cylinder. If the temperature increase is large enough, this stress can cause the steel cylinder to deform and even crack.

However, if the temperature increase is small, the resulting strains and stresses may be within the elastic limits of the materials, which means that the system will return to its original shape once the temperature returns to its initial value. This illustrates the concept of elastic deformation, where a material deforms under stress but returns to its original shape once the stress is removed.
