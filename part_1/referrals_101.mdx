## Growth Hacking for Engineers
We’re big believers in learning by doing. As a mechanical engineer working in industry, theory can only take you so far! The real design process involves iterative prototyping and lots of trial-and-error.

The more you build, the better you get at engineering!
<Tip>
Don't have an internship lined up for the summer? Try building a project you've always been interested in!
It could be an electric skateboard, electric bike, woodworking, anything. Just start building.
</Tip>


For those starting out, we've identified **three common ways to gain experience** without necessarily having an internship or full-time job.

## Project Oriented Coursework
While most academic engineering majors have a large focus on theory (which is still very important!), **we recommend that you take the opportunity to take as many project-oriented classes as possible.**

<Tip>
The sooner you take project-oriented classes, the more material you can add to your resume.
</Tip>

Here’s why:

1. **An easy portfolio project addition:** get your school credits while slapping another project on your portfolio—two birds with one stone!
2. ********Learn how to work on a team:******** so much of school is focused on the individual. With the constant pressure of your GPA hanging over your head, it’s easy to forget that team projects are an opportunity to build soft skills that will carry on with you for the rest of your career.

It’s important to learn how to work on a team—delegate tasks, drive meetings, and align with your teammates. At a company, you can’t do everything yourself, and you’re going to have to compromise with cross functional teams & work with difficult teammates. Start practicing early.

### Course Suggestions
Here are examples of project-oriented classes common in all undergraduate ME programs:

<Info>
Not all schools assign the same name to the classes listed below. Read the syllabus and get tips from upperclassmen on which classes were particularly helpful!
</Info>

1. Computer Graphics in Design
    - Course that focuses on teaching you how to use CAD software (most commonly Solidworks for undergraduate programs).
2. Manufacturing Processes
    - Hands-on class that teaches common fabrication techniques. Involves the use of your school's prototyping lab
3. Mechanical Design
4. Mechatronics
5. Senior Design
    - Course with a capstone project that acts as a culmination of your undergraduate degree. Depending on the school/particular major, you could be partnering with real companies, small businesses, or research labs on campus!


## Personal Projects

Not all learning happens in the construct of academic settings or jobs. Quite often, the best engineers you'll meet developed their skills by working on passion projects!

Personal projects act as a playground where you can dive into real-world challenges, test your knowledge, and push the boundaries of your current abilities. To cap it off, they look great on your resume too.

Personal projects look great on resumes because:

1. Demonstrate passion and initiative
2. Showcase technical skills you otherwise didn't highlight before (due to lack of job experience, etc.)
3. Differentiate you from other candidates

Some of the most creative and best engineers I've come across on the internet developed a large majority of their technical skillset through tinkering on projects. Good examples include:

- [Shane Wighton - Stuff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/@StuffMadeHere/videos)

### Getting Started with Personal Projects

On any personal project you decide to take on, remember the best thing you can do is to start building! From our personal experience, it doesn't matter if you're building projects from scratch or following a guide online. The best way to start learning is by doing.

If you're looking for inspiration, take a look at these project repositories listed here:
1. [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/discover)
2. [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)
3. [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/projects)
4. [Hackster](https://www.hackster.io/)
5. [Arduino Project Hub](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/)

<Tip>
As you're working your way through the project, make sure to document the entire journey, from napkin sketches, CAD designs, and final prototypes. These are easy additions to your design portfolio while you're working on the project.
</Tip>
Document the entire project, from sketching to CAD screenshots to 3D printed prototypes

## Student Engineering Organizations

If you're in an undergraduate engineering program, make sure to join competition engineering teams and clubs centered hands-on engineering!

Common engineering competition teams you'll find at most schools include programs like:
1. Formula SAE: University teams compete to design and manufacture the best performing racecars.
2. Baja SAE: Similar to FSAE, but teams design small off-road cars.


You'll also find clubs around universities that build and compete in all sorts of competitions like cube satellites, UAVs, drones, and much more.

<Tip>
Most schools now also have start-up centers! Check-out their events to learn more, it's a great way to meet individuals with similar interests in building products.
