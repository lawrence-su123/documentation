If you have doubts about whether or not you‚Äôre going to be able to land a job, fear not! The fact that you‚Äôre here puts you ahead of 90% of people in terms of initiative.

Half of the battle is knowing where and how to find opportunities in the first place.

## The low hanging fruit üçä

[**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/)

As we mentioned in the [daily routine](https://www.notion.so/The-daily-routine-0a0ea28d9bf74f03a92f95cc08f234ec) actions, you should be applying to at least 5 jobs a day during your recruitment season. If you have no offers, go for volume and apply to a variety of roles but once you land an offer, you can become more selective.

LinkedIn‚Äôs algorithm does a decent job of recommending you jobs you are interested in, so once you have the chance to be more selective, make sure you are applying to roles that are close to your [ideal job](https://www.notion.so/Define-find-your-dream-job-5c2034ed986f4412bc8708f416020f35).

**Google Jobs:**

Searching directly on Google is also a good starting point. You can use the same search terms on both LinkedIn and Google to find internships/jobs at different locations.

## Job Titles & Search Terms

When you first start out, it‚Äôs a good idea to search across a broad range of roles and locations to increase the number of open positions, and exposure to different job functions. Working at different types of internships can help you figure out what you‚Äôre looking for in an ideal job, and the scope of work you‚Äôre most interested in.

üíº Good starting search terms for mechanical engineering positions (full-time/internships) include:

<Note>
The job titles are essentially the same for full-time or internship! Just swap 'intern' for 'engineer'.
</Note>

1. Mechanical Engineering Intern
2. Product Design Engineering Intern
3. Mechanical Design Engineering Intern
4. Manufacturing Engineer Intern
5. Systems Engineering Intern
6. Test Engineering Intern
7. Manufacturing Test Intern
8. Hardware Test Intern
9. Supplier Quality Engineering Intern
10. Hardware Quality Engineering Intern
11. Product Quality Engineering Intern

## Medium Hanging Fruit üçà
**Career fairs**

Career fairs are an amazing way to guarantee a recruiter sees your resume. Better yet, here‚Äôs one of our secret tips to killing a career fair: **bring your [portfolio.](https://www.notion.so/65f57863d950451dbe926d43fb2b3cf5)**

In a sea of black and white text resumes, bringing a physical printout of your portfolio is going to help you stand out from the crowd. This is an absolute hack, and we‚Äôve seen tons of our mentees land jobs through this method.

Companies will often schedule same-day interviews for positions they‚Äôre recruiting for, so it‚Äôs a great way to get a foot in the door. If you‚Äôre able to get the recruiter or hiring manager‚Äôs name, reach out to them directly on LinkedIn as well (read our [cold-emailing guide here](https://www.notion.so/Cold-Emailing-Guide-6305095bc3104694836c5b8561238a73)).

**Universities & Research Institutions**

If you're just getting started and struggling to land jobs, get a position as an undergraduate research assistant!

Research positions are a low-barrier-to-entry means of getting hands-on experience to add to your resume. Professors have stipends allocated by the university to pay undergraduate research assistants, so they are more than happy to accept your sweat-equity as an eager, bright-eyed undergraduate student.

Find labs online that are doing interesting research online, and reach out to the professors on the websites of your choice (emails are often on the lab page). **It‚Äôs important to do your research on professors you reach out to, and express your interest in the specific work they are doing.** This will put you ahead of most students who mass-email any and every professor they can find, and it will also help you focus on labs you actually find interesting.

## Referrals - The secret to getting jobs ü§´

Did you know, most students at working at top companies don‚Äôt get jobs by simply applying on the company website?

<Tip>
On average, recruiters/hiring managers spend **less than 20 seconds** reading a resume. More mind-blowing, is that **98.8% of Fortune 500 companies** use automated applicant tracking systems (ATS) to automatically accept/reject candidates.
</Tip>

Recruiters are not incentivized to sift through every resume that gets submitted into the application portal. Chances are, half the resumes you submit aren‚Äôt even getting seen!

> **‚ÄúStudies have shown that up to 75% of resumes from qualified applicants never make it out of the ATS database into human hands.‚Äù**


That‚Äôs why you need to get a referral, or at least slip your referral in ‚Äúthrough the backdoor‚Äù by contacting a recruiter or engineer on the team. **This is by far, the most efficient way to land interviews**. The question is, how do you find and meet these people?

Here are a couple of different strategies to try out:

**Strategy 1:** Utilize your own network at school! Reach out to upperclassmen through friends of friends or LinkedIn

**Strategy 2:** Find people on LinkedIn who have a career trajectory you‚Äôd like to emulate. Reach out to these people using our [cold email guide.](https://www.notion.so/Cold-Emailing-Guide-6305095bc3104694836c5b8561238a73)

**Strategy 3:** Look for mechanical engineering content online or projects you‚Äôd want to work on. Find the people who were behind those people and reach out to them through the [cold email guide.](https://www.notion.so/Cold-Emailing-Guide-6305095bc3104694836c5b8561238a73)

Remember‚Äîfor all of these methods‚Äîthe one tool you have at your disposal is genuine curiosity and a willingness to learn. Most people are willing and happy to share gems of knowledge (as others did for them) as long as you are enthusiastic about learning from them.
